<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am Wilson Siaw but people call me Wilson. I am training to be a <strong>front-end developer</strong> with Azubi Africa. I am also training to be
  a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> with Full Stack Open. I enjoy all things tech and am happiest when sitting in front of my
  computer solving problems and writing code.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond writing code, I enjoy watching football and am a Manchester City fan. I also enjoy watching movies. I am a big fan of Game of Thrones,
  the Star Wars franchise, and, any Marvel Comics movies.
