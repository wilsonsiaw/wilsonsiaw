<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am Wilson Siaw but people call me Wilson. I am training to become a <strong>front-end developer</strong> with Azubi Africa. I am also training to be
  a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> with The Odin Project. I enjoy all things tech and am happiest when sitting in front of my
  computer solving problems and writing code.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond writing code, I enjoy watching football and am a Manchester City fan. I also enjoy watching movies. I am a big fan of Game of Thrones,
  the Star Wars franchise, and, any Marvel Comics movies.

<h2>Featured Projects</h2>

<h4>Countries Application</h4>
<p>
  In this project, I developed a React application that connects to an external API and renders the information of over 200 countries. The application also features
  a light and dark mode theme and lets you view a detailed page of a specific country.

<h4>GitHub User Search App</h4>

  In this project, I built an application that uses the GitHub API to return the information of different users of GitHub. The application was built using React and can render
  specific user information. It also features a light and dark mode.
</p>

available [here](https://github-user-search-app-ten-pearl.vercel.app/).

<h4>To-do Application</h4>

  In this project, I built a to-do application that helps users track their daily activities or tasks. It allows users to add new tasks to a task list. Remove tasks and also mark tasks as   
  completed.
